This repository contains the implementation of the functions and algorithms described in Sections 4 and 5 of the paper Structure Learning of Homogeneous Decomposable Models.

In particular, the code includes:

Integer Linear Programming formulations for learning the structure of homogeneous decomposable models;

LP relaxations of the homogeneous chordal graph polytope based on local constraints;

Extensions incorporating a maximum clique size constraint;

Procedures for synthetic data generation;

Numerical experiments and performance evaluation using the Structural Hamming Distance (SHD).

The main goal of this repository is to study and evaluate exact and relaxed optimization-based approaches for structure learning in undirected graphical models with homogeneity constraints.
