# Structure-learning-of-homogeneous-decomposable-models
This repository implements the algorithms described in Sections 4 and 5 of Structure Learning of Homogeneous Decomposable Models, including ILP formulations, LP relaxations for homogeneous chordal graphs, clique size constraints, and numerical experiments for structure learning.
